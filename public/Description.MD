**Register page Using node js.,mongodb, jade**
A simple, user-registration form.
It requires the user to enter their Name, email-address,
username, confirmation of above password and profile image.
After the details are filled, the user has to click the ‘register’
button-which invokes form validation.
Should the user fail to fill out/fill out invalid details in any of the 
required fields [or not accept the terms and conditions]-the form 
displays an error message and highlights the invalid field, if 
necessary. 
If the details entered are valid-the page redirects automatically to 
the login page.


**Login page Using nodejs, mongodb, jade and css**
In order to login to the music player-the customer must have
previously registered to the site, with a valid username and 
password. To check this, the collection created in mongodb is 
checked by nodejs-for the username and password. If and only if 
the username and password match, is the site opened to the user.

**MAIN page using  html,javascript and css MAIN MEDIA-PLAYER PAGE**
For designing the layout and styling the main-page we have used 
various Front-End framework and languages like HTML, CSS, 
JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP and AJAX. 
Here, we used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to structure and design 
the webpage so that it could make the project look unique. 
Basically, for structure of webpage it is divided into header, 
container and footer section. 
In header logo of the media player and various functionalties like 
Log-Out and About Us are present which are mainly displayed and 
styled using the flex properties. 
In container to align the buttons we have mainly used CSS 
positioning properties, tranform properties to apply a 2D or 3D 
transformation for buttons and also background properties to 
style the container. 
For footer section, we have mainly used HTML and JAVASCRIPT 
properties to insert a small media player which could play songs 
in background while the user is busy doing his/her own stuff or 
browsing something on the internet. It is basically inserted to 
enhance the user's experience with some cool visual effects. The 
media player has a previous and next button functionality so that 
the user could choose the songs of his choice and also there is a 
progress bar with the player to show the status of the song being 
played. 
To summarise, this part of the code involves a lot of front end 
designing work when compared to backend. Also for the database 
we have used AJAX to connect this framework to the server-side. 
A lot of frames, pictures, styles and scripts have been involved in 
this section of the webpage.


**Button design and implementation using HTML and JavaScript**
For designing the framework of button we have used HTML, CSS 
and JAVASCRIPT. The button is designed such that, when the user 
clicks on it-it auto-redirects to the relevant playlist on YouTube. 
Buttons are control fields, with which it is possible to trigger an 
action within the site. 
Using CSS styling properties we have created buttons with 
animation which gives an extraordinary look to our webpage. We 
have considered every aspect in our code to design the button like 
what will be displayed when the cursor is placed on the button, the 
transition period for the animation, the opacity and also the 
transformation scale. It is important to give each button its own 
look and feel so each button is photoshopped according to the 
genres of music. We made good use of all the size, color, 
whitespace and typography options and created a visual weight 
that helps the button to stand out from the rest of the elements 
inside the interface.


**App.js (for running the nodejs file)**
The app.js code for running the main NodeJS and site

**Feedback form using  html,jquery,nodejs, mongodb  and angular js**
The feedback form has been designed with angular js (for validation), jqeury (for 
preparing a slideshow behind the page), html, mongodb (for inserting the values 
into the database) and node js (for connecting to the database).

**Logout page using  html,jade,node js and  mongodb**
